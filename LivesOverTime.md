# Introduction #

**_Lives over time_** is a free online genealogy tool allowing you to browse through the lives of people of different places over time. Using events that occur at a given place and time and between a set of people, we can create a new type of genealogy tree that is easier to browser.

The other interesting aspec of having a free online tool (and open source at the same time) is that anybody can contribute to it. This also allows the possibility of finding links that people were not expecting with data that others have entered. Of course, there are some restrictions that can be applied for people that don't want random users to mess with their data

Using a graph where the vertical axis is a set of places and the horizontal axis is time, the life of an individual is a rectangle starting at their birth and ending at their death.

Interaction between people are identified with line events connecting them using vertical lines. For example, a birth event marks the begining of an indivudal's life and is connected to at least a living mother at the same point in time and space, and potentially a father if he was still alive when his child was born. Same thing for a wedding event, it's a line at a given place and time and linking two individuals.
